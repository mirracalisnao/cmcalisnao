Right now, I do not have any skills to be proud of. I am still honing my skills in programming and things that are related to my course.

I love doing nothing. But kidding aside ✌️, I am fond of editing pictures and lay outing some infographics. 
   
  
                        👍 LIKES
   
What I like the most is sleeping. I can sleep for 12 hours.
    
I also love coffee. Everytime I feel so stress, I just drink coffee and it makes me calm.
   
I really love to travel despite the fact that I have a motion sickness.
